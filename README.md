Hello, I am Harpreet Singh.

And the source code updated is deployed on AWS EC2 machine that auto-deploys the docker swarm stack whenever git commits is received.
A complete CI/CD integration is done with automatic deployment.

Github >> Jenkins(builds and compresses the code) >> Docker machine deploys code on docker swarm >> ELK stack works with filebeat to see logs generated by App.
